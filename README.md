# Dragon 32 Brainfuck Interpreter

Bored of BASIC? No problem!

## Usage

Due to the Dragon's lack of `[` and `]` characters, which are quite important in brainfuck, the inputs have been swapped with `(` and `)`.
As for some reason square brackets are in the character set but there are no keys for it on the keyboard!

## Compiling

To compile, `asm6809` is needed, optionally `bin2cas` and `dragondos` but these two are not required for building the binary and are just to create the disk and tape images.
